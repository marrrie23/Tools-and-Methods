# Analyzing the Evolution of Environmental Themes in Children's Literature

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore and analyze the evolution of environmental themes in children's literature from the 1960s to the present. By examining a range of children's books over the last six decades, this study seeks to understand how environmental themes are presented, their frequency, and the changing nature of these representations in relation to broader societal attitudes towards environmental issues.

## Research Context

Environmental themes in children's literature reflect changing societal concerns about nature and conservation. This research builds on previous studies in the fields of literary analysis, environmental studies, and children's literature, including foundational works like Dr. Seuss's "The Lorax." By examining these themes over time, we aim to understand the interplay between societal environmental concerns and their representation in children's literature.

## Research Question and Hypothesis

- **Research Question:** How have environmental themes and representations in children's literature evolved from the 1960s to the present day?
- **Hypothesis:** There is an increasing prevalence and complexity of environmental themes in children's literature, mirroring the growing societal awareness and concern for environmental issues.

## Methodology

### Approach
- The project involves a comparative textual analysis of a curated selection of children's books spanning from the 1960s to the present.
- The focus will be on identifying and analyzing the portrayal and frequency of environmental themes.

### Data
- A diverse selection of children's books from each decade, with a focus on titles that encompass environmental themes.
- Sources will include digital collections from libraries, publishers' archives, and online repositories.

### Tools and Analysis
- **Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizing tools for thematic analysis such as NLTK.
- **Data Visualization:** Employing tools like Tableau/Flourish to represent trends and patterns in the data.

## Project Significance

This project aims to contribute to the understanding of how environmental issues are communicated to younger audiences through literature. The findings could have implications for educational strategies, environmental communication, and the study of children's literature as a reflection of societal values.
